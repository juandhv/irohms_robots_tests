# The static map layer represents a largely unchanging portion of the costmap, like those generated by SLAM. 
- {name: static_layer, type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
# The obstacle layer tracks the obstacles as read by the sensor data. The ObstacleLayer Plugin marks and 
# raytraces obstacles in two dimensions, while the VoxelLayer Plugin does so in three dimensions. 
- {name: obstacle_layer, type: "costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer"}
# The inflation layer is an optimization that adds new values around lethal obstacles (i.e. inflates the obstacles) 
# in order to make the costmap represent the configuration space of the robot.
